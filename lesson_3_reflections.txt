git remote: lets you see what remotes a repository has (list)
git remote add (origin)(url): add a remote to your repository. insert your GitHub link as the url. origin is the standard name for having only one remote

git remote -v: lets you see a “verbose” listing of remotes (more information)

git push (remote) (name of local branch to push): push branch using remote to GitHub

git pull (remote) (name of branch you want to pull): pull branch from github to your own computer, attempting to merge

forking: cloning within the context of git hub 
cloning from github automatically makes a remote named origins for you

if you want someone to be able to push to your repository on github, make them a collaborator on the project 

when two people are modifying the same fork, to resolve conflict, run...bash? 

git fetch (remote): if your local and github versions repository are different, git fetch will pull the stuff from gitHub but add it to a new branch (called origin/master?) on your local repository without merging, where you can check the differences with git diff and such. you can then merge them if you want with git merge origin/master master

(this process is what git pull does: fetch and then merge)

fastforward merge: when the branch you're merging into is an ancestor of the other (there is a direct path following the graph between each node)

to make master branch the same as the one in the 

git pull upstream master will make your local master into the most update master from the GitHub repository
